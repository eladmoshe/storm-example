=============

### General Description

This application is a basic reference implementation of client side JavaScript Single Page Application, using the JavaScript frameworks Backbone.js, 
Backbone.Marionette, Twitter Bootstrap and Jade. It represents a stripped down version of Storm's implementation. 
Obviously there is more than one way to implement an application, so you may not agree with all design decisions.
It is not meant to represent the best way to implement such application. Rather, it represents the solution that 
was chosen for Storm.
